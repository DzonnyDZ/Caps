There are some of DLLs required by this project in this folder.
I mainly use DLLs from my other project ÐTools (http://tools.codeplex.com), but I often use newer than last release bits for this application.
Another reference of this project is WPFToolkit.dll, which can be obtained from http://wpf.codeplex.com.
