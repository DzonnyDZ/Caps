This project requires some external DLL references.

I mainly use DLLs from my other project ÐTools (http://tools.codeplex.com), but I often use newer than last release bits for this application.
If you don't want to download and build these DLLs, replace project references with DLLs in this folder.

Another reference of this project is WPFToolkit.dll, which can be obtained from http://wpf.codeplex.com.
